*#Coffee Club*

The project involves designing and developing a new website for a coffee shop that will improve their online presence, attract more customers, and increase sales revenue.
The website will include features such as an online ordering system, a menu with pricing information, customer reviews, and contact information. The online ordering system will allow customers to place their orders and pay online, reducing wait times and improving customer satisfaction. The menu will provide customers with information about the coffee shop's products and pricing, and the customer reviews will help build trust and credibility with potential customers.
The website will also integrate with social media platforms, such as Facebook and Instagram, to increase the coffee shop's online visibility and reach.
